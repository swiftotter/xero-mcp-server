# Xero MCP Server (SwiftOtter fork)

A Model Context Protocol server for Xero. This is SwiftOtter's fork of [XeroAPI/xero-mcp-server](https://github.com/XeroAPI/xero-mcp-server) with a **hosted remote-MCP mode** added on top of the upstream stdio modes.

## Two ways to run it

### 1. SwiftOtter team — remote MCP connector (recommended)

The server is deployed at `https://xero-mcp-1074937591843.us-central1.run.app/mcp`. Every teammate gets there via Claude Desktop's native OAuth connector UI:

> Claude Desktop → **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector** → paste `https://xero-mcp-1074937591843.us-central1.run.app/mcp` → **Connect** → sign in to Xero in the browser → done.

No CLI, no config-file editing, no tokens to share. Every Xero write is auto-annotated with a History note crediting the real user (since Xero's API attribution always shows the app name in the platform's own audit log).

Operational docs:
- [`scripts/README-onboarding.md`](scripts/README-onboarding.md) — admin runbook for first-time GCP setup and per-user onboarding
- [`scripts/DEPLOY.md`](scripts/DEPLOY.md) — what's deployed today, how to ship updates, verification snippets, troubleshooting

### 2. Local stdio (upstream pattern)

Run the server directly inside Claude Desktop via `npx`, talking to Xero with your own Custom Connection or bearer token. See the "Custom Connections" / "Bearer Token" sections below. This is the right path if you're not on SwiftOtter or you want to develop against the server locally.

## Features

- **Hosted remote MCP server** (SwiftOtter fork) with OAuth 2.1 authorization-code flow for Claude Desktop, chained through Xero's OAuth so every user authenticates as themselves
- **Three auth modes** for the stdio path: Custom Connection (`client_credentials`), bearer token, or authorization-code via Secret Manager (used by the hosted remote-MCP mode)
- **Per-user audit notes** posted to Xero's History tab on every successful write, naming the authenticated teammate
- Contact, invoice, credit note, payment, manual journal, quote, item, bank transaction, repeating invoice, attachment, tax rate, tracking category, and read-only reports (P&L, balance sheet, trial balance)
- MCP protocol compliance (Streamable HTTP + stdio transports)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or pnpm
- A Xero developer account with API credentials

## Setup

### Create a Xero Account

If you don't already have a Xero account and organisation already, can create one by signing up [here](https://www.xero.com/au/signup/) using the free trial.

We recommend using a Demo Company to start with because it comes with some pre-loaded sample data. Once you are logged in, switch to it by using the top left-hand dropdown and selecting "Demo Company". You can reset the data on a Demo Company, or change the country, at any time by using the top left-hand dropdown and navigating to [My Xero](https://my.xero.com).

NOTE: To use Payroll-specific queries, the region should be either NZ or UK.

### Authentication

There are 3 modes of authentication supported in the Xero MCP server. The hosted remote-MCP service uses mode 3 internally — modes 1 and 2 are for the upstream stdio pattern (running the server directly inside Claude Desktop via `npx`).

#### 1. Custom Connections

This is a better choice for testing and development which allows you to specify client id and secrets for a specific organisation.
It is also the recommended approach if you are integrating this into 3rd party MCP clients such as Claude Desktop.

##### Configuring your Xero Developer account

Set up a Custom Connection following these instructions: https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/oauth2/custom-connections/

Currently the following scopes are required for all sessions: [scopes](src/clients/xero-client.ts#L91-L92)

##### Integrating the MCP server with Claude Desktop

To add the MCP server to Claude go to Settings > Developer > Edit config and add the following to your claude_desktop_config.json file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "xero": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@xeroapi/xero-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "XERO_CLIENT_ID": "your_client_id_here",
        "XERO_CLIENT_SECRET": "your_client_secret_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

NOTE: If you are using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) `"command": "npx"` section change it to be the full path to the executable, ie: `your_home_directory/.nvm/versions/node/v22.14.0/bin/npx` on Mac / Linux or `"your_home_directory\\.nvm\\versions\\node\\v22.14.0\\bin\\npx"` on Windows

#### 2. Bearer Token

This is a better choice if you are to support multiple Xero accounts at runtime and allow the MCP client to execute an auth flow (such as PKCE) as required.
In this case, use the following configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "xero": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@xeroapi/xero-mcp-server@latest"],
      "env": {
        "XERO_CLIENT_BEARER_TOKEN": "your_bearer_token"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

NOTE: The `XERO_CLIENT_BEARER_TOKEN` will take precedence over the `XERO_CLIENT_ID` if defined.

#### 3. Authorization Code (used by the hosted remote-MCP mode)

When `XERO_APP_CLIENT_ID`, `XERO_APP_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `XERO_REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET_NAME` are all set, the server uses Xero's full OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code grant with refresh-token rotation. The refresh token is read from (and written back to) GCP Secret Manager at the resource named in `XERO_REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET_NAME`. This is how the hosted Cloud Run service authenticates each request as the right user — each per-session child gets the caller's secret name in env.

You won't typically configure this mode by hand. It's wired up automatically by `src/cloud-run-entrypoint.ts` + `src/mcp-handler.ts` when the server runs as the shared Cloud Run service. See [`scripts/DEPLOY.md`](scripts/DEPLOY.md) for the deploy.

##### Required Scopes for Bearer Token

When obtaining a bearer token, you must request the appropriate scopes. The scopes you request should be:

> **Note:** Some scopes are being deprecated in favour of more granular scopes. See the [Xero OAuth 2.0 Scopes documentation](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/oauth2/scopes/) for details on deprecation timelines.
